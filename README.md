# Cpp-decConverter
A program that takes any number of base 10 and converts it to a binary, octal or hexadecimal number. 

Simply, the code does just that and the way it's achieved is to use the modulo (%) sign to divide the decimal number by the value of the new base, then place the remainder in a new array or vector untill your remainder is 0.
